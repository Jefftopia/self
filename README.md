## Runs on

- Angular 7
- ngrx/store
- D3
- SCSS for styling
- AWS S3 for static hosting

This project uses the Angular CLI as well as Nrwl extensions.
I also used the Angular Console to quickly scaffold the application (but all the fun stuff is hand-made).


## Setup


### Dev

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`


### Build

1. `npm run build`
